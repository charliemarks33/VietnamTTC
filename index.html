    <h2>Coming Home—But Never the Same</h2>
    <p>For many Vietnam veterans, returning home didn’t mean peace. It meant silence, misunderstanding, and memories too heavy to carry. The war was over—but the battle within was just beginning.</p>

      “I came back to a world that didn’t know me. I left part of myself in the jungle, and what returned… wasn’t whole.” — Vietnam veteran, 1974

    <h2>“That night when Kiowa got wasted...”</h2>
    <p>“That night when Kiowa got wasted, I sort of sank down into the sewage with him.” (<em>The Things They Carried</em>, ch. 16, p. 150)</p>
    <p>This moment speaks volumes about the guilt that soldiers often carried. When Kiowa died, it wasn’t just about a loss — it was about the shame and helplessness of surviving when someone close to you didn’t. The narrator sinking into the sewage is not just physical; it’s symbolic of emotional ruin. He’s literally buried in the waste of war, blaming himself, and unable to separate from that trauma. Many soldiers came home with this same type of survivor's guilt, where living felt harder than dying.</p>

    <h2>“You become part of a tribe...”</h2>
    <p>“You become part of a tribe and you share the same blood.” (<em>The Things They Carried</em>, ch. 20)</p>
    <p>War breaks people apart but also forms intense, unbreakable bonds. The quote shows how soldiers felt like they were in something deeper than friendship—it was a tribal identity. When you go through something as brutal and dehumanizing as combat, you cling to those around you because no one else can understand. Veterans often came home and found they couldn’t connect with anyone besides their fellow soldiers. That isolation only made the pain worse.</p>

    <h2>“The last battle ended 20 years ago...”</h2>
    <p>“The last battle ended 20 years ago, but if the end of a war is peace, we’re still waiting for it.” (Tobias Wolff, "After the Crusade")</p>
    <p>This quote expresses how veterans felt stuck in the war even decades later. Physically, they returned home, but mentally, emotionally, they were still in Vietnam. They were haunted by flashbacks, broken relationships, and constant anxiety. Peace isn’t just the absence of violence; it’s the presence of healing. For many, that healing never came, which is why Wolff’s words hit so hard. They show how war doesn’t really end when the fighting stops.</p>

    <h2>“Is it possible to win a battle...”</h2>
    <p>“Is it possible to win a battle and lose the war?” (Lessons from the Tet Offensive)</p>
    <p>The Tet Offensive was technically a military loss for the North Vietnamese, but it became a huge psychological blow to the U.S. Back home, Americans started to realize that even our wins looked like losses. Soldiers were putting their lives on the line and watching friends die, all while the war seemed more and more pointless. The quote sums up how morale eroded: you can fight and win, but still feel like nothing has been accomplished. For many veterans, that made their sacrifices feel ignored.</p>
