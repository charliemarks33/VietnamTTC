    <h2>“That night when Kiowa got wasted...”</h2>
    <p>“That night when Kiowa got wasted, I sort of sank down into the sewage with him.” (<em>The Things They Carried</em>, ch. 16, p. 150)</p>
    <p>This moment captures a profound kind of survivor’s guilt. The narrator isn’t just remembering the death of a friend—he’s sinking into it. The physical sewage represents the emotional waste that war leaves behind. It's about how loss traps you in a place where you can’t pull yourself out. Soldiers returning from Vietnam often found themselves in this kind of internal hell—carrying the lives of the dead with them, unable to clean the memories off. What made it worse was how few people back home understood or even acknowledged that trauma.</p>

    <h2>“You become part of a tribe...”</h2>
    <p>“You become part of a tribe and you share the same blood.” (<em>The Things They Carried</em>, ch. 20)</p>
    <p>O'Brien isn't just talking about camaraderie—he's talking about survival through shared trauma. Soldiers formed a brotherhood not by choice, but out of emotional necessity. Their bond became sacred because it was built in the worst moments of their lives. The battlefield created a kind of family that couldn’t be replicated once they came home. That made reintegration nearly impossible. Many veterans said they felt more at home in combat than they did in civilian life, because only their fellow soldiers understood what it was like to live between life and death every single day.</p>

    <h2>“The last battle ended 20 years ago...”</h2>
    <p>“The last battle ended 20 years ago, but if the end of a war is peace, we’re still waiting for it.” (Tobias Wolff, "After the Crusade")</p>
    <p>This line echoes what so many Vietnam veterans felt after coming home: the shooting stopped, but the war didn’t. The pain, nightmares, anxiety, and emotional numbness stuck with them for decades. Peace never came because their minds were still at war—still rewinding the past, replaying moments of death, and questioning why they survived. Tobias Wolff’s quote is a reminder that veterans don’t just need parades. They need healing, and many never got it. That’s why the war didn’t end for them—it simply changed location.</p>

    <h2>“Is it possible to win a battle...”</h2>
    <p>“Is it possible to win a battle and lose the war?” (Lessons from the Tet Offensive)</p>
    <p>This quote summarizes the heartbreak of the Vietnam War. Soldiers could execute perfect missions, fight bravely, and still feel defeated. The Tet Offensive was a major shock that flipped the war’s narrative. Even though U.S. troops technically won, public confidence collapsed. For the soldiers, this meant that their sacrifices seemed to have no meaning. Many felt betrayed—by the media, by the government, and by the silence they faced at home. It wasn’t just about fighting anymore. It became a question of whether what they were doing mattered at all.</p>
