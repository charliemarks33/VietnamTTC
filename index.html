    <div class="banner">Welcome Home, Soldier</div>
    <p>The Vietnam War didn't end when soldiers boarded flights back to the United States. For many, the battlefield came with them—in their minds, in their hearts, in the way they saw the world. This site is a tribute to their inner battles, the emotional scars that never healed, and the silent strength it took to carry on.</p>
    <div class="interactive">
      <p>Sometimes, trauma is invisible. This block symbolizes how much can be hidden behind silence and routine.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="glow-text">“The war is over, but it lives in me.”</div>
    <p>Long after the guns stopped firing, the memories kept echoing. Flashbacks, nightmares, guilt, and isolation weren’t visible to the public. But for the veterans, they were daily battles. Many were never taught how to cope or even how to talk about what they'd been through. Instead, they buried it—and in doing so, buried parts of themselves.</p>
    <p>This page is more than a history lesson. It's a window into the emotional reality of war. What we see in textbooks often misses the lived experience. So here, we look deeper. We reflect on pain, loss, brotherhood, and what it means to come home changed forever.</p>

      <strong>Chart: Emotional Conditions Reported by Vietnam Veterans (1975-1990)</strong>
      <p>[Chart would show rates of PTSD, depression, substance use, suicide risk]</p>
    </div>
    <p>As a country, we weren’t ready to support our returning soldiers. But today, we can do better by listening—truly listening—to their stories. Through their pain, we can learn the cost of conflict, the power of memory, and the value of understanding.</p>

    <h2>“That night when Kiowa got wasted...”</h2>
    <p>“That night when Kiowa got wasted, I sort of sank down into the sewage with him.” (<em>The Things They Carried</em>, ch. 16, p. 150)</p>
    <p>This quote brings us face-to-face with the emotional consequences of survival. The narrator doesn't just lose a friend—he loses a piece of himself. In this moment, we see how death doesn't stop at the battlefield. It infects the living. The imagery of sewage is raw and uncomfortable, just like grief. There’s no glory in this loss, only filth and guilt.</p>
    <p>For many veterans, moments like this defined their time in Vietnam. Watching someone die and being unable to stop it builds a kind of guilt that never fully fades. The weight of that memory keeps returning, especially when it feels like no one back home understands the burden. This wasn’t just war—it was trauma layered in silence.</p>

  <section id="tab2">
    <h2>“You become part of a tribe...”</h2>
    <p>“You become part of a tribe and you share the same blood.” (<em>The Things They Carried</em>, ch. 20)</p>
    <p>This quote shows how deeply connected soldiers became—not just as teammates, but as something closer to family. War doesn’t let you stay a stranger to the people around you. When you're fighting side by side, day after day, you become linked by more than uniforms. You're connected by shared fear, pain, and hope.</p>
    <p>The idea of a “tribe” is powerful. It’s not about choice. It's about survival and trust. And when soldiers came home, that tribe was gone. The bonds they made in Vietnam didn’t translate into civilian life, and that left a hole. Many veterans said they felt more understood on the battlefield than in their own neighborhoods. That’s the kind of emotional shift that lingers long after the last bullet is fired.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="tab3">
    <h2>“The last battle ended 20 years ago...”</h2>
    <p>“The last battle ended 20 years ago, but if the end of a war is peace, we’re still waiting for it.” (Tobias Wolff, "After the Crusade")</p>
    <p>Wolff’s words hit hard because they’re not just poetic—they’re real. For veterans, the war didn’t end when they flew home. It kept going in their heads. The fight shifted from jungles and bullets to memories and regret. Some veterans even said coming home was harder than being in combat, because at least in Vietnam, they knew their purpose.</p>
    <p>This quote reminds us that peace isn’t just the absence of war—it’s the presence of healing. And for many, that healing never happened. Some struggled with addiction, others with broken families, and many with the silence that greeted them when they tried to open up. Peace is a process, not a plane ride.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="tab4">
    <h2>“Is it possible to win a battle...”</h2>
    <p>“Is it possible to win a battle and lose the war?” (Lessons from the Tet Offensive)</p>
    <p>This question is more than strategy—it’s about emotion. The Tet Offensive was supposed to be a turning point, and in some ways, it was. But not the way we hoped. Even though the U.S. technically won the battle, public opinion crumbled. Soldiers fought with everything they had, but the war at home was being lost—on TV screens, in political debates, and in people’s hearts.</p>
    <p>For veterans, that made their sacrifices feel meaningless. They gave everything for a war people stopped believing in. That sense of betrayal stuck with them. They weren’t just fighting an enemy overseas—they were fighting to prove their service mattered. And many felt like they lost both battles.</p>
