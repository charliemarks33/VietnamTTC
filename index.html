    <div class="banner">Welcome Home, Soldier</div>
    <p>For many, the journey home from Vietnam wasn’t a return to comfort or understanding—it was an arrival into confusion, neglect, and emotional chaos. Soldiers stepped off planes into a world that felt completely disconnected from what they had experienced. There were no ticker-tape parades. There were stares. There were questions. There was silence.</p>
    <p>This site is built to explore that emotional aftermath. It's about more than history—it’s about memory, pain, brotherhood, and trauma that doesn’t fade. It's a space to step inside their mental battles and understand the price they paid that isn't measured in physical scars.</p>
    <div class="interactive">
      <p>This space represents what isn’t said. What stays buried. What surfaces in the quiet moments of the night.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="glow-text">“The war is over, but it lives in me.”</div>
    <p>Veterans returned to families who didn’t know how to talk to them, jobs that didn’t wait for them, and a country that often wished to forget them. What followed was a quiet epidemic of mental health struggles: PTSD, anxiety, depression, addiction. And yet, their pain was rarely acknowledged out loud. It was easier to pretend the war ended at the border.</p>
    <p>But the war didn’t end. It continued—in memories, in relationships that unraveled, in dreams that shattered, in lives that felt suspended. To understand these veterans is to recognize that for them, Vietnam was not a chapter. It was a thread woven through every chapter after.</p>

    </div>
    <p>To learn from history means we face all of it—not just the victories, but the weight carried by those who came home. By hearing their stories, we carry a piece of that weight with them, and maybe, help lighten it just a bit.</p>

    <h2>“That night when Kiowa got wasted...”</h2>
    <p>“That night when Kiowa got wasted, I sort of sank down into the sewage with him.” (<em>The Things They Carried</em>, ch. 16, p. 150)</p>
    <p>Tim O’Brien’s words here aren’t just describing a moment of physical chaos—they’re expressing a collapse of the self. In that instant, surrounded by death and filth, the narrator didn’t just witness tragedy. He internalized it. His friend Kiowa was gone, and in trying to recover his body, the narrator is symbolically trying to pull himself out of the same spiritual quicksand.</p>
    <p>This moment captures the unbearable guilt that many soldiers carried. The sewage isn't just a setting—it’s a metaphor for the moral and emotional decay that follows death in war. It represents helplessness. That no matter how much you try to rescue or redeem what you lost, you’re already drowning in it yourself. And for veterans who lived through moments like this, those feelings often lingered for decades, resurfacing in guilt, depression, or a haunting sense that they didn't do enough—even when they did everything they could.</p>
